# bitsy

This is a scuffed mod of Bitsy to double the tile and sprite size.

The mod is almost entirely based on https://github.com/Level0gamedev/bitsy_X2, but ported into Bitsy 8. 

This is on a clean fork of the base bitsy to contain any messes that may be caused.

Many thanks to @Level0gamedev and @synth-ruiner for the original mod!
